          Hi! I'm <b>Juan David Pardo Forero</b>, a Software Engineering student
          passionate about web development, cybersecurity, and low-level
          programming. I enjoy solving challenges, learning new technologies,
          and optimizing systems. I'm seeking an internship to apply
          my knowledge and grow in a professional environment. I believe
          technology has no limitsâ€”only those set by our creativity and
          problem-solving mindset. ðŸ’¡ðŸ”¥
